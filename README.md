# Best-basic-calculator
My first ever python code its a simple calculator

Its a simple calculator writen with python3 
all you need to do is run python3 Calculiatorius.py to test it out it has + - * / and a pwr function

P.S. its writen in my native language Lithuanina the pwr function is called "laipsnis" and most of the text output is in Lithuanian
